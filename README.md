Abstract: To improve the performance of blanket: maximizing the tritium breeding rate (TBR) for tritium self-sufficiency, and minimizing the Dose of backplate for radiation protection, most previous studies are based on manual corrections to adjust the blanket structure to achieve optimization design, but it is difficult to find an optimal structure and tends to be trapped by local optimizations as it involves multi-physics field design, which is also inefficient and time-consuming process. The artificial intelligence (AI) maybe is a potential method for the optimization design of the blanket. So, this paper aims to develop an intelligent optimization method based on an improved multi-objective NSGA-III algorithm and an adaptive BP neural network to to solve these problems mentioned above. This method has been applied on optimizing the radial arrangement of a conceptual design of CFETR HCSB blanket. Finally, a series of optimal radial arrangements are obtained under the constraints that the temperature of each component of the blanket does not exceed the limit and the radial length remains unchanged, the efficiency of the blanket optimization design is significantly improved. This study will provide a clue and inspiration for the application of artificial intelligence technology in the optimization design of blanket.
